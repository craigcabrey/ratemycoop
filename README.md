Rate My Co-op is a new service built to allow students to look up information about companies. Search for (and add more) companies, read reviews, and add your own experiences from which others can benefit.

# Technology Stack

The application is a fairly standard stack consisting of Node.js, loopback.io, AngularJS, and Semantic UI.

# Getting started 

To get the entire stack running, you must set up your client and your backend.

## Client Setup

All of the client stuff is in the `client` directory
Assuming you have `node`, `bower`, `grunt` and `grunt-cli` installed

```
cd client/
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

On success, bower should open up your browser to the default `:9000` port. 

## Backend Setup

A lot of it is abstracted, so just run:

```
npm install   # To install dependencies
npm start     # To run the server with sample data in memory
```

The result is an in memory local database with limited initial test data on port `:3000`.
Head to `http://localhost:3000/explorer` to see and interact with the API explorer. 


## OS X 10.10

1. Start by installing [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (following *all* instructions).
2. Next, execute `brew install node`.
3. In the root of the repository directory, execute `npm install`.
4. If you're only working on the backend, you can simply run `node server/server.js`.
5. For frontend development, execute `npm install -g bower grunt-cli`.
6. Change into the `client/` directory and execute `npm install`.
7. Finally, execute `grunt serve` to start the local development server.

# Reporting Issues

Include a succinct title for your issue that gives a quick summary about the problem. It is extremely helpful if you include steps to reproduce the problem in the description (including environment information such as browser version).

# Troubleshooting
## Grunt serve fails with an infinite loop on the watch command:

* Known Issue on Ubuntu

  * Fix: Increase the number of files allowed to be watched by a user

    * `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`
